    'Drone view of waves crashing against the rugged cliffs along Big Sur\'s garay point beach. The crashing blue waters create white-tipped waves, while the golden light of the setting sun illuminates the rocky shore. A small island with a lighthouse sits in the distance, and green shrubbery covers the cliff\'s edge. The steep drop from the road down to the beach is a dramatic feat, with the cliff\'s edges jutting out over the sea. This is a view that captures the raw beauty of the coast and the rugged landscape of the Pacific Coast Highway.{"reference_path": "assets/images/condition/cliff.png", "mask_strategy": "0"}',
